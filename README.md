# My Star Wars Site

This project was created to *practice* my skills such as:
* HTML
* CSS / Sass
* JavaScript
* Webpack
* API

On this website you can research specific information
from Characters, Planets, Films, Vehicles, Starships &
Species from Star Wars Saga.

The API used for this web is:

by _horizontal scroll_ & look for the information you are 
interested on.
